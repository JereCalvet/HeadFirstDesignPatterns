Strategy pattern:
    Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them, interchangeable.
    Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
    
Disign principles:
    *Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. Page 9
    *Program to an interface, not an implementation. Page 11
    *Favor composition over inheritance. Page 23
